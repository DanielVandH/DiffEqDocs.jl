# Solver Benchmarks

Benchmarks for the solvers can be found at
[benchmarks.sciml.ai](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLBenchmarksOutput/stable/).
The source code can be found at
[SciMLBenchmarks.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBenchmarks.jl).
A variety of different problems are already tested.
However, if you would like additional problems to be benchmarked, 
please open an issue or PR at the SciMLBenchmarks.jl repository
with the code that defines the DEProblem.
