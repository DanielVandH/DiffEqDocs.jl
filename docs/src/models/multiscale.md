# Multi-Scale Models

The multi-scale modeling functionality is provided by MultiScaleArrays.jl. It
allows for designing a multi-scale model as an extension of an array, which in
turn can be directly used in the native Julia solvers of DifferentialEquations.jl.

For more information, please see [the MultiScaleArrays.jl README](https://github.com/SciML/MultiScaleArrays.jl).
