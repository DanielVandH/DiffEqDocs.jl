# [Global Sensitivity Analysis] (@id gsa)

Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods are used to quantify the uncertainty in
output of a model w.r.t. the parameters, their individual contributions, or the
contribution of their interactions. The GSA interface allows for utilizing batched
functions for parallel computation of GSA quantities.

For more information, see the documentation on [GlobalSensitivity.jl](https://gsa.sciml.ai/dev/).
